Pocket Operator is an application capable of generating music based on a userâ€™s locative
and accelerometer data. User data is used to generate Markov Chains that dictate the possible
chord progressions a generated composition can use, this data is also used to dictate the rhythm
and complexity of an accompaniment melody. The program is specially built to be tailored
towards people with little to no musical experience with movement being the primary way to
interact with the system, more specifically, exercise scenarios such as walking or running.
However, more musically inclined users can turn off these features and use the application as a
semi automated Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). The application is available in both mobile and
desktop versions.
